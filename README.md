# flutter-auto-localize README

This is a work in progress VS-Code plugin to help you create flutter localizations.

## Features

flutter-auto-localize provides a command that adds a selected string literal to an '.arb' file in your flutter project. The translation key has an automatically generated preset based on the string but can also be changed. If not already in the file flutter-auto-localize also adds the required import for you.
'.arb' file are automatically detected in the project. If there is more than one file to consider, you are prompted to select one.

## Extension Settings
To be implemented...
- Changing the import line
- Changing the replacement
- Selecting a default translation file
(Also enable project wide overrides)
